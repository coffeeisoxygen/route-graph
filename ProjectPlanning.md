## 6. Additional Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Edge Representation for Pipes:**
   Define pipes as a separate class (e.g., `PipeEdge`) that connects two nodes, with properties such as maximum flow capacity and operational status. This will improve the maintainability of the network model.

2. **Topology Validation:**
   Implement a topology check using graph traversal algorithms (like DFS/BFS) to ensure the network is well-connected and free from isolated nodes.

3. **Flow Direction Algorithm:**
   Develop a simple mechanism to determine the direction of flow from source nodes to demand nodes based on elevation or predefined priorities.

4. **Failure Simulation:**
   Add the ability to simulate failures in pipes or nodes to test how the network handles disruptions.

5. **Simplified Visualization:**
   Since map rendering is not planned, focus on creating a straightforward graph-based visualization. Represent pipes as straight lines connecting nodes without complex components like valves or tanks.

6. **Performance Optimization:**
   Keep computation efficient by avoiding unnecessary recalculations for static properties and optimizing graph traversal during simulations.

This plan provides a structured yet flexible approach for your initial water distribution simulation project, with room for iterative improvements as complexity grows.
